on their agents the need to be able to go back into the records e.g for callbacks etc  and then update them

Leighton Power, [08.11.16 23:52]
a search ? maybe ?

@DONE



add DAY into the reporta ma so we knwo where we are today without counting, 
to see our current DAY Packout rate and how their agents %PO
@ONDE
	
these figures are out
when you click on the name (screenshot attached) the percentage is correct but on the dashboard its not, maybe use the figures inside their name then.
@TO BE TESTED


when you get a chance guys, just count how many packs our agent have send and do the maths then
guest01 4 pox1 out of 6 so defenitely nnot 17.39 %a
nyway its obiviously piccking up more leads than 6 somehow
total we sent is 23, so just break it down



all the data is there just check guys
also need DAY on the dashboard also when u guys have a chance eg. "Day Week Month"
